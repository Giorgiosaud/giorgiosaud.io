# {title}
As i can show you in astro we can have at least 2 ways of make content .md files and .mdx files. The difference between them is that .mdx files can have JSX code and .md files can't.

Like this example we can use components from different frameworks in the same page.

## Here is Svelte
A Server side rendered component loaded in client side

<ButtonSvelte client:load></ButtonSvelte>

## Here is React 
A Server side rendered component loaded in when client is idle

<ButtonReact client:idle title="Increment Count React" />

<div class="h-screen"></div>

## Here is Vue 
A server side redered but component loaded reactivity in when is visible

<ButtonVue client:visible />


In a md file we cant do this because is more for static content and we can't use JSX code in it.
