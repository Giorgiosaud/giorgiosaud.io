### Project Overview: Fundación de la Mujer

**Objective:**  
The goal of this project was to create a simple yet effective site for managing credit summaries and enabling users to check credit details. The site was designed to streamline the process for users of Fundación de la Mujer, providing them with easy access to their financial information.

**Technology Stack:**  
We utilized **Vue.js**, **vanilla JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap 4** to develop this platform. The choice of these technologies ensured a responsive, user-friendly interface that could efficiently handle the required functionalities.

**Role:**  
As the **Front-End Architect**, I was responsible for designing the overall architecture of the site, ensuring that it adhered to best practices and could easily integrate with other systems.

**Challenges & Solutions:**  
A significant challenge was connecting to the client's SSO (Single Sign-On) system and managing the client APIs. To overcome this, I implemented a robust integration strategy that ensured seamless authentication and secure API communication.

**Key Features:**

- **Credit Summary Management:** Users could easily view and manage their credit summaries.
- **Loan Details Check:** A feature that allowed users to check the detailed status of their loans.

**Outcome:**  
The project was successfully released on time, with a **microfrontend architecture** that allowed for better scalability and maintainability.

**Duration:**  
The project was completed in **3 months**, meeting all the client's requirements.

**Collaboration:**  
This project was a collaborative effort with the **Modyo team**, where teamwork and effective communication played key roles in its success.

**Learning:**  
This project provided valuable experience in implementing SSO within Modyo and managing logged-in APIs, enhancing my ability to work with secure authentication systems.
