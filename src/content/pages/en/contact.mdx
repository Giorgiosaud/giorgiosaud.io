# 📬 Contact Me

> Let's connect and build something great.


Whether you have a question, want to collaborate, or just want to say hi — I’d love to hear from you. I believe that the best ideas often come from conversations, and I’m always open to chatting about web development, architecture, or anything tech-related.

Feel free to reach out via any of the channels below:

- 📧 Email: [jorgelsaud@gmail.com](mailto:jorgelsaud@gmail.com)
- 💼 LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/giorgiosaud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giorgiosaud/)
- 🌐 Website: [giorgiosaud.io](https://giorgiosaud.io)
- 📝 Blog: [giorgiosaud.io/notebook](https://giorgiosaud.io/notebook)

If you're a fellow developer, architect, or just getting started — I’d be happy to connect and exchange ideas.

Thanks for stopping by!
