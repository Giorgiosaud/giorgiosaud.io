# 🙏 Acknowledgements

Building and maintaining **Giorgiosaud.io** has been a journey of learning, creativity, and collaboration. This platform is more than just a notebook — it's a reflection of the knowledge, experiences, and inspiration I've gathered over the years. I’d like to take a moment to express my gratitude to the people and communities who made it all possible.

## 👨‍👩‍👦 To My Family  
To my amazing wife and son — thank you for your unconditional love, patience, and support. You are my daily motivation and the reason I strive to grow and share what I learn.

## 💻 To the Developer Community  
This site wouldn't exist without the generosity of the global developer community — individuals who openly share their expertise, collaborate to solve problems, and inspire constant innovation. Platforms like **GitHub**, **Stack Overflow**, and countless developer blogs have been invaluable resources throughout my journey.

## 🤝 To My Colleagues and Mentors  
Thank you to my colleagues at **Modyo**, **Zonapro**, and the many other projects I've had the privilege to work on. Your collaboration and challenges have helped me grow both technically and personally.

To my mentors — both formal and informal — your guidance has been instrumental in shaping my vision as a solutions architect and my human-centered approach to software development.

## 📚 To My Readers  
Whether you're here to learn something new, solve a specific problem, or just explore — **thank you**. Your curiosity, feedback, and engagement keep this notebook alive and constantly evolving.
