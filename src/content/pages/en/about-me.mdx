# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I’m **Jorge Luis Saud Rosal** — a curious mind who became a developer not by title, but by solving problems. I’m an Industrial Engineer by degree, a Solution Architect by trade, and a dad by heart. 👨‍👦

This site is my **digital notebook** — a space where I unpack technical ideas in simple words. I created it for developers like me: those who had to figure things out on the go, who learned by doing, breaking, and rebuilding.

## 🛠 From Engineer to Architect

My journey into development wasn’t linear. I started out in logistics, sales, and even real estate appraisal. But whenever a challenge needed a digital fix, I was the one rolling up my sleeves — coding, configuring, and delivering.

Over the past 15+ years, I’ve gone from building WordPress sites at my own company in Venezuela to leading architecture for financial platforms in Chile. Now, at [Modyo](https://www.modyo.com), I help teams design decoupled frontends, integrate APIs, and build solid, scalable systems.

## 🧠 Why This Notebook Exists

I built this notebook to explain complex concepts in a way that anyone on a team — from junior dev to product owner — can understand. It’s not about being the smartest in the room, it’s about making sure **everyone gets it**.

Here you’ll find:
- Real-life notes from projects using **Vue**, **TypeScript**, **Stencil.js**, and microfrontends
- Solutions for challenges like **SSO**, **API integration**, and **SPA SEO**
- Architecture insights from working with major banks and financial institutions across Latin America
- Lessons learned from balancing tech leadership with the chaos (and joy) of parenthood

## 💡 My Motto

<section class="full-width text-center focus">
<h2>A day without learning is a lost day.</h2>
</section>

Whether I’m debugging code, mentoring a teammate, or helping my son discover how things work — I’m always learning, and I believe sharing what we learn makes us all stronger.
