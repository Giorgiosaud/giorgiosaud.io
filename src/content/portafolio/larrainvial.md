### Project Overview: Larrainvial Private Site

**Objective:**  
The goal of this project was to create a robust and secure website for Larrainvial's private channel. Larrainvial is a renowned wealth management company that offers clients various investment options, including Cuenta Activa, Mutual Funds, and APV. The website's primary function was to enable seamless API connections to backend services, making it easier for clients to manage their investments and personal information.

**Technology Stack:**  
To build this platform, we utilized **Modyo** as the microfrontend platform, which allowed us to segment the site into various business domains. The core of the development involved multiple **Vue 2** applications that managed key aspects such as:

- Investment summaries
- Fund management
- Account management
- Personal information
- KYC forms and regulatory compliance

**Role:**  
As the **Main Front-End Developer**, I was responsible for making crucial decisions on how the site was structured and separated into different microfrontends. My role involved not just coding but also strategizing the overall front-end architecture to ensure scalability and efficiency.

**Challenges & Solutions:**  
One of the biggest challenges was that the project was already behind schedule when I joined. I took the initiative to reorganize the development process, focusing on delivering the platform's value in a shorter timeframe without compromising on quality. By implementing more efficient workflows and prioritizing key features, we were able to meet the tight deadlines and deliver a functional site that met all client requirements.

**Outcome:**  
The final product was a fully functional, user-friendly site that met all the client's needs. The modular approach allowed for easier management of different business domains, providing a seamless experience for Larrainvial's clients.
