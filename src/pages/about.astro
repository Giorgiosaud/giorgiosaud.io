        Why This Blog?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        As a solution architect, I frequently find myself explaining complex concepts and solutions to developers. I realized the need for a single source of truth to streamline these explanations and ensure consistency. This blog was born out of that necessity, aimed at simplifying the recurring challenges faced by developers and integrators.
