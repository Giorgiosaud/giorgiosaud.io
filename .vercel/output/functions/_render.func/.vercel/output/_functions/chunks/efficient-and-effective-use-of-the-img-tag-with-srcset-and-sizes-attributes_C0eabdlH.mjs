This width should be defined with two parameters: the media query used in the image example <code>(min-width: 600px)</code> (this is an example of what happens if the image has this min-width) and the image width which can be <code>50%</code> of the viewport represented by <code>50vw</code>. You can separate each media query <code>+</code> width with commas, leaving the last (the minimum in this case without a media query to use as default).
