The site was designed to provide an easy and efficient way for customers to browse a catalog and redeem their points.\n\n**Role:**  \nAs the **Front-End Architect**, I was responsible for designing and implementing the architecture of the site, ensuring it met the client's requirements while maintaining high performance and scalability.\n\n**Challenges & Solutions:**  \nOne of the significant challenges was integrating an external API for redemptions into the site while maintaining a seamless front-end session within a Single-Page Application (SPA) built on Modyo. This required advanced techniques to ensure that the site could be indexed by Google despite being JavaScript-driven. To achieve this, I implemented SEO techniques tailored for JavaScript applications, ensuring proper indexing and visibility on search engines. Additionally, I handled global stores and routing within Modyo to provide a smooth user experience.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Catalog Display:** Users can browse through a catalog of available items for redemption.\n- **Point Redemption:** The site allows users to redeem their accumulated points directly within the app.\n\n**Outcome:**  \nThe project was completed on time and successfully delivered a functional, user-friendly site that met all of Copec's needs.\n\n**Client:**  \nCopec, a prominent company in the energy and retail sector in Chile, was the client for this project.\n";
