To activate CSP, one must set up the server configuration to include the Content-Security-Policy header. Alternatively, a meta tag can be used, although it&apos;s not recommended.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 15:39:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Repository pattern is called Data Layer Architecture</title><link>https://giorgiosaud.io/notebook/repository-pattern-revisited/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://giorgiosaud.io/notebook/repository-pattern-revisited/</guid><description>The Repository Pattern in frontend development is included in the Data Layer architecture because it concerns about Repositories and datasources abstracted from the UI layer and the Domain Layer, only taking the data transmission as part of the scope of its interactions.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 13:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Repository pattern in frontend</title><link>https://giorgiosaud.io/notebook/repository-pattern/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://giorgiosaud.io/notebook/repository-pattern/</guid><description>The Repository Pattern in frontend development abstracts data access logic, enhancing code maintainability and testability by encapsulating operations and promoting loose coupling.
