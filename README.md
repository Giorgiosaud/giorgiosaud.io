# Giorgiosaud blog

This blog started from [Astroship](https://astroship.web3templates.com/)*

but the live site is in [Giorgiosaud.io](https://giorgiosaud.io)


I added some functionalities as i18n, added frameworks support for some components and some others features like contact form and so on.

## Installation

I use pnpm to manage the dependencies, you can use yarn or npm.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surjithctly/astroship.git myProjectName
# or
git clone https://github.com/surjithctly/astroship.git .
```

The `.` will clone it to the current directory so make sure you are inside your project folder first.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Start development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Preview & Build

```bash
pnpm preview
pnpm build
```

We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to save disk space on your computer.

### Other Commands

```bash
pnpm astro ...
pnpm astro add
pnpm astro --help
```

## TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is already configured in this repo, so you can start using it without any installation.
